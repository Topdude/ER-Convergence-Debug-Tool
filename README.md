# ER-Convergence-Debug-Tool
A debug tool, originating from Nordgaren's Debug Tool (https://github.com/Nordgaren/Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool) to work for Convergence, adding convergence items.


To use this, go into the inventory tab at the bottom of the debug tool, click on the Category drop-down at the top right of the tool, and you'll find 5 sections:

Armor: Consisting of the new armors added by Convergence.

Melee Weapons: Every new melee weapon added/modified by Convergence.

Remnants: All Remnants added by Convergence.

Runes: All runes (faint, shimmering, glowing, and so on) added by Convergence.

Staffs and Seals: All new staffs and seals added by Convergence.


# Installation

Unpack the Resource folder, then simply move it into the Debug Tool folder (looking like this: https://imgur.com/a/VSMwGxf), and click Replace Files, and it should work.

# Notice

# If I missed anything, any tools, consumables, etc, if anything is not working correctly then please do tell me, I may or may **not** be able to fix it, sending me the item ID would also be incredibly helpful to adding said items, thank you.
